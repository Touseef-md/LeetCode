Not able to build the logic, myself.<br>
Do it again.<br>
**Logic was:**<br>
if k==1, then only rotation of the string is possible, this means we have to find the lexicographically smallest just by rotating the string.<br>
else, Any permutation of the string is possible,  this means that the answer is the smallest lexicographically string possible out of the characters of the string.
