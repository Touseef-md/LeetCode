**NOT ABLE TO GET THE LOGIC CORRECT**
<br>
I was trying to make a dp state such that if we have a solution to the problem of circle having n elements then we can figure out a solution of n+1 elements JUST AS THE SOLUTION TO THE **JOSEPHEUS PROBELM**.
<br>
**DO IT AGAIN**
<br>
Saw the Hint.
<br>
**SOLUTION**
<br>
I just have break the problem into the simpler problem in an array, and use the same algorithm in 2 piecesi.e. from i=0 to n-2 and n=1 to n-1.
