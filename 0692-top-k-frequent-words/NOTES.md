I made a mistake, didn't understood the question correctly. <br>
I cannot take only k elements from the priority queue because it may occur that all of them have the same frequency , in that case I'll be removing the options from which I've to sort them lexicographically.<br>
So I can k elements only when I've sorted them in the lexicographically order.
