**Took way too time to build the logic in S.C.:O(n)**

**Forgot how to use priority_queue in this question. Already done this question on simple array.**
<br>
**Solution**
<br>
Iterate through each and every element and push k+1 elements in the priority_queue and always pop the max element from the priority_queue, this will ensure that we'll have k smallest elements in the priority_queue.
<br>
There is also a edge case, see the code.
